# Cantina-App

This repository contains a web application project for a student canteen.

The project includes implementation of a web application, authentication (with two main roles: admin and users), form validation, database interogations using PDO and API integration using PHP for dynamic data.

This app uses vanilla HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, jQuery and was made using XAMPP server.

Thank you!
